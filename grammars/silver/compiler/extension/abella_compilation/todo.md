Features
======================================================================
* Pattern matching needs to be added
* Accessing `.fst` or `.snd` on a pair need to be handled specially
  because pairs are treated as primitives
* Local attributes in functions---might require not using
  `encodedExpr` for functions, or perhaps a flag for production
  vs. function
* Consider unifying away function calls with the same arguments.
