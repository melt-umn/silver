======================================================================


Features
======================================================================
* Failure clauses for equations need to be added
* Pattern matching needs to be added
* Unification of eqMetaterms in cleaning clauses
* Unification/general cleaning for function clauses
* Accessing `.fst` or `.snd` on a pair need to be handled specially
  because pairs are treated as primitives
* Local attributes in functions---might require not using
  `encodedExpr` for functions, or perhaps a flag for production
  vs. function
