# Silver

Silver is an extensible attribute grammar system that support many
modern extensions to Knuth's original design.  These include
higher-order attributes, reference attributes, forwarding, aspects,
and collections attributes.  Its type system support parametric
polymorphism.  Silver is distributed with Copper, a parser and
context-aware scanner generator.

It is designed for the modular development of composable language
extensions, with language features and analyses to support this.

## Using silver

Silver requires Java 8, Ant, Bash, and wget. It can run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in Windows 10.

See [The Silver Install Guide](http://melt.cs.umn.edu/silver/install-guide)
for detailed information on how to get Silver set up.

Silver is written in Silver, which means after cloning the GitHub
repository you still need the executable Java jar files. You can download
these by running the ``update`` script in this repository. This will do a
`git pull` to update, then download jars, and clear any files generated
by older versions of Silver. A one-stop-shop for updating after the
initial clone.
